-- Comprehensive test to verify Bardic Inspiration and Song of Rest isolation
-- This script tests all layers of protection to ensure non-Bard classes don't get Bard features

-- 1. Database Level: Verify class table data
SELECT '=== DATABASE LEVEL VERIFICATION ===' as test_section;

-- Check that only Bard classes have non-zero bardic inspiration
SELECT 
    'Non-Zero Bardic Inspiration Classes' as test_name,
    name,

WHERE bardic_inspiration_uses != ARRAY[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0];

-- Check that non-Bard classes have zero bardic inspiration

        THEN 'PASS: Correctly has no bardic inspiration'
        ELSE 'FAIL: Has bardic inspiration data'
    END as result
FROM classes
WHERE name != 'Bard';

-- 2. Class Features Level: Verify class features are properly assigned
SELECT '=== CLASS FEATURES LEVEL VERIFICATION ===' as test_section;

-- Check Bard-specific features are only in Bard class
SELECT

-- 3. Test what would happen for a Wizard character
SELECT '=== WIZARD CHARACTER SIMULATION ===' as test_section;

-- Simulate loading class data for a Wizard

    name,

-- 4. Test what would happen for a Bard character
SELECT '=== BARD CHARACTER SIMULATION ===' as test_section;

-- Simulate loading class data for a Bard
SELECT 
    'Bard Class Data' as test_name,
    id,

-- Simulate what class features a Bard would get
SELECT

    cf.feature_type
FROM class_features cf
JOIN classes c ON cf.class_id = c.id
WHERE c.name = 'Bard' AND c.subclass = 'College of Lore'
ORDER BY cf.level, cf.title;

-- 5. Edge case testing
SELECT '=== EDGE CASE TESTING ===' as test_section;

-- Test with invalid class_id
SELECT 
    'Invalid Class ID Test' as test_name,
    'Should return empty result' as expected_result;

-- Test with level 0 (should not return any features)
SELECT

-- 6. Summary
SELECT '=== SUMMARY ===' as test_section;
SELECT 
    'Protection Layers' as test_name,
    '1. Database: Non-Bard classes have zero bardic inspiration arrays' as layer_1,
    '2. Function: getBardicInspirationFromClass checks class name' as layer_2,
