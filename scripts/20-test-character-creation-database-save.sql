-- Test script to verify character creation saves to database
-- This script tests that new characters are properly saved to the database

-- 1. Check current characters in database
SELECT '=== CURRENT CHARACTERS IN DATABASE ===' as test_section;

SELECT 
    'Existing Characters' as test_name,
    id,
    name,
    class_name,
    subclass,
    class_id,
    level,
    race,
    background,
    alignment,
    created_at,
    updated_at
FROM characters
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- 2. Test character creation data structure
SELECT '=== CHARACTER CREATION DATA STRUCTURE ===' as test_section;

-- Example of what the character creation would insert
SELECT 
    'Sample Character Creation Data' as test_name,
    'New Character' as name,
    c.name as class_name,

-- 3. Verify required fields for character creation
SELECT '=== REQUIRED FIELDS VERIFICATION ===' as test_section;

SELECT 
    'Required Fields Check' as test_name,
    column_name,
    is_nullable,
    column_default,

WHERE table_name = 'characters' 
  AND column_name IN ('name', 'class_name', 'subclass', 'class_id', 'level', 'race', 'background', 'alignment')
ORDER BY column_name;

-- 4. Test infusions column for new characters
SELECT '=== INFUSIONS COLUMN FOR NEW CHARACTERS ===' as test_section;

SELECT 
    'Infusions Default Value' as test_name,
    '[]'::jsonb as default_infusions,
    'Empty array for new characters' as description,
    'Artificer characters can add infusions later' as note;

-- 5. Test class_id relationship integrity
SELECT '=== CLASS_ID RELATIONSHIP INTEGRITY ===' as test_section;

-- Check if all characters have valid class_id relationships
SELECT 
    'Class ID Relationship Check' as test_name,
    COUNT(*) as total_characters,
    COUNT(class_id) as characters_with_class_id,
    COUNT(*) - COUNT(class_id) as characters_without_class_id
FROM characters;

-- 6. Test character creation flow validation
SELECT '=== CHARACTER CREATION FLOW VALIDATION ===' as test_section;

-- Check if we have classes available for character creation
SELECT 
    'Available Classes for Creation' as test_name,
    COUNT(*) as total_classes,
    COUNT(DISTINCT name) as unique_class_names,
    COUNT(DISTINCT subclass) as unique_subclasses
FROM classes;

-- 7. Test character creation with proper class_id
SELECT '=== CHARACTER CREATION WITH CLASS_ID ===' as test_section;

-- Example of inserting a new character (this would be done by the application)
SELECT 
    'Character Creation Example' as test_name,
    'INSERT INTO characters (name, class_name, subclass, class_id, level, race, background, alignment, infusions, class_features, tools, feats) VALUES' as insert_statement,

-- 8. Summary of character creation database flow
SELECT '=== CHARACTER CREATION DATABASE FLOW SUMMARY ===' as test_section;
SELECT 
    'Character Creation Database Process' as test_name,
    '1. User fills modal form with character details' as step_1,
    '2. Character created in local state with temporary ID' as step_2,
    '3. saveCharacter() called with character data' as step_3,
    '4. Database generates UUID and saves character' as step_4,
    '5. Local state updated with database UUID' as step_5,
    '6. Character becomes active in sidebar' as step_6,
    '7. Spell slots updated based on class and level' as step_7,
    '8. Success toast shown to user' as step_8;
