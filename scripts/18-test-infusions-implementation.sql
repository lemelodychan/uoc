-- Test script to verify infusions implementation
-- This script tests that the infusions column and functionality work correctly

-- 1. Verify infusions column exists in characters table
SELECT '=== INFUSIONS COLUMN VERIFICATION ===' as test_section;

SELECT 
    'Infusions Column Check' as test_name,
    column_name,
    data_type,
    is_nullable,
    column_default
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'characters' 
  AND column_name = 'infusions';

-- 2. Test inserting a character with infusions
SELECT '=== INFUSIONS DATA TEST ===' as test_section;

-- Create a test character with infusions (this would be done by the application)
-- Example of what the infusions JSONB would look like:
SELECT 
    'Sample Infusions Data' as test_name,
    '[
        {
            "title": "Enhanced Weapon",
            "description": "A simple or martial weapon gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.",
            "needsAttunement": false
        },
        {
            "title": "Bag of Holding",
            "description": "A bag of holding can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet.",
            "needsAttunement": false
        },
        {
            "title": "Cloak of Protection",
            "description": "While wearing this cloak, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws.",
            "needsAttunement": true
        }
    ]'::jsonb as sample_infusions;

-- 3. Test querying infusions data
SELECT '=== INFUSIONS QUERY TEST ===' as test_section;

-- Test querying characters with infusions
SELECT 
    'Characters with Infusions' as test_name,
    id,
    name,
    class_name,
    infusions
FROM characters
WHERE infusions IS NOT NULL 
  AND jsonb_array_length(infusions) > 0;

-- 4. Test infusions filtering by attunement requirement
SELECT '=== INFUSIONS FILTERING TEST ===' as test_section;

-- This would be used by the application to filter infusions by attunement requirement
SELECT 
    'Infusions Requiring Attunement' as test_name,
    'Query to find infusions that need attunement' as description,
    'SELECT * FROM characters, jsonb_array_elements(infusions) AS infusion WHERE infusion->>''needsAttunement'' = ''true''' as sample_query;

-- 5. Test infusions count per character
SELECT '=== INFUSIONS COUNT TEST ===' as test_section;

SELECT 
    'Infusions Count by Character' as test_name,
    name,
    class_name,
    jsonb_array_length(infusions) as infusion_count
FROM characters
WHERE infusions IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY infusion_count DESC;

-- 6. Test infusions index performance
SELECT '=== INFUSIONS INDEX TEST ===' as test_section;

SELECT 
    'Infusions Index Check' as test_name,
    indexname,
    indexdef
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE tablename = 'characters' 
  AND indexname LIKE '%infusions%';

-- 7. Summary of expected functionality
SELECT '=== IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY ===' as test_section;
SELECT 
    'Infusions Implementation Features' as test_name,
    '1. JSONB column stores array of infusion objects' as feature_1,
    '2. Each infusion has title, description, and needsAttunement fields' as feature_2,
    '3. Only appears for Artificer characters in UI' as feature_3,
    '4. Add/Edit/Delete functionality in character sheet' as feature_4,
    '5. Automatic saving to database' as feature_5,
    '6. GIN index for efficient JSONB queries' as feature_6;
