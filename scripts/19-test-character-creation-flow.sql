-- Test script to verify character creation flow
-- This script tests the database functions and data structure for character creation

-- 1. Verify classes table has the expected data
SELECT '=== CLASSES TABLE VERIFICATION ===' as test_section;

SELECT 
    'Available Classes and Subclasses' as test_name,
    name as class_name,
    subclass,
    id as class_id
FROM classes
ORDER BY name, subclass;

-- 2. Test the loadAllClasses function equivalent
SELECT '=== LOAD ALL CLASSES TEST ===' as test_section;

SELECT 
    'Classes Query for Modal' as test_name,
    COUNT(*) as total_classes,
    COUNT(DISTINCT name) as unique_classes,
    COUNT(DISTINCT subclass) as unique_subclasses
FROM classes;

-- 3. Test character creation with proper class_id
SELECT '=== CHARACTER CREATION TEST ===' as test_section;

-- Example of what the character creation would insert
SELECT 
    'Sample Character Data' as test_name,
    'New Character' as name,
    c.name as class_name,
    c.subclass,
    c.id as class_id,
    1 as level,
    'Human' as race,
    'Folk Hero' as background,
    'True Neutral' as alignment
FROM classes c
WHERE c.name = 'Bard' AND c.subclass = 'College of Lore'
LIMIT 1;

-- 4. Verify character table structure supports new fields
SELECT '=== CHARACTER TABLE STRUCTURE ===' as test_section;

SELECT 
    'Character Table Columns' as test_name,
    column_name,
    data_type,
    is_nullable,
    column_default
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'characters' 
  AND column_name IN ('class_id', 'subclass', 'infusions')
ORDER BY column_name;

-- 5. Test infusions column for new characters
SELECT '=== INFUSIONS FOR NEW CHARACTERS ===' as test_section;

SELECT 
    'Infusions Default Value' as test_name,
    '[]'::jsonb as default_infusions,
    'Empty array for new characters' as description;

-- 6. Test class-subclass relationship integrity
SELECT '=== CLASS-SUBCLASS RELATIONSHIP ===' as test_section;

SELECT 
    'Class-Subclass Pairs' as test_name,
    name as class_name,
    subclass,
    CASE 
        WHEN subclass IS NULL OR subclass = '' THEN 'Base Class Only'
        ELSE 'Has Subclass'
    END as class_type
FROM classes
ORDER BY name, subclass;

-- 7. Test character creation validation
SELECT '=== CHARACTER CREATION VALIDATION ===' as test_section;

-- Check if we have at least one class with subclass for testing
SELECT 
    'Validation Check' as test_name,
    CASE 
        WHEN COUNT(*) > 0 THEN 'PASS: Classes with subclasses available'
        ELSE 'FAIL: No classes with subclasses found'
    END as validation_result
FROM classes 
WHERE subclass IS NOT NULL AND subclass != '';

-- 8. Summary of character creation flow
SELECT '=== CHARACTER CREATION FLOW SUMMARY ===' as test_section;
SELECT 
    'Character Creation Process' as test_name,
    '1. User clicks "New Character" button' as step_1,
    '2. Modal opens with form fields' as step_2,
    '3. Classes loaded from database' as step_3,
    '4. User selects class and subclass' as step_4,
    '5. User fills in name, race, background, alignment' as step_5,
    '6. Character created with proper class_id' as step_6,
    '7. Character added to sidebar and becomes active' as step_7,
    '8. Spell slots updated based on class and level' as step_8;
