-- Test script to verify Artificer spells known respects stored database values
-- This script tests the fix for manually set spells_known values

-- 1. Test the logic flow for Artificer spells known
SELECT '=== ARTIFICER SPELLS KNOWN LOGIC FLOW ===' as test_section;

SELECT 
    'Artificer Spells Known Priority' as test_name,

-- 2. Test scenarios for Artificer spells known

-- 5. Test character creation vs existing character loading
SELECT '=== CHARACTER CREATION VS LOADING ===' as test_section;

-- 6. Test edge cases

-- Edge case 2: storedValue = null
SELECT 
    'Edge Case 2: storedValue = null' as test_name,
    'Expected: Calculate dynamically' as expected,
    'Logic: null means no stored value' as logic;

-- Edge case 3: storedValue = undefined

SELECT 
    'After Fix' as after_fix,
    'Artificer respects stored database values' as after_behavior,

-- 9. Summary of the fix
SELECT '=== FIX SUMMARY ===' as test_section;
