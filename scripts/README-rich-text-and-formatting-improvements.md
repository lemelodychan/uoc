# Rich Text and Formatting Improvements

This document outlines the implementation of rich text editing capabilities and improved formatting for character descriptions and class features.

## Implementation Overview

### **Rich Text Editing Implementation**

#### **1. Modal Updates**
All editing modals now use `RichTextEditor` instead of basic `Textarea` components:

- **InfusionsModal**: Infusion descriptions now support rich text formatting
- **FeaturesModal**: Custom feature descriptions now support rich text formatting  
- **FeatsModal**: Feat descriptions now support rich text formatting

#### **2. Display Updates**
All character sheet displays now use `RichTextDisplay` for proper rendering:

- **Infusions**: Rich text descriptions with proper formatting
- **Class Features**: Rich text descriptions with improved structure
- **Feats**: Rich text descriptions with proper formatting
- **Custom Features**: Rich text descriptions with proper formatting

### **Class Features Formatting Improvements**

#### **Previous Issues**
- Long, dense paragraphs that were hard to read
- No visual hierarchy or structure
- Difficult to scan for specific information
- Poor readability on mobile devices

#### **New Formatting Structure**
- **Clear headings** using `**bold text**` for sections
- **Bullet points** using `- ` for lists and options
- **Line breaks** for better paragraph separation
- **Organized sections** for different aspects of features
- **Progression tables** for level-based improvements

#### **Formatting Examples**

**Before (Bardic Inspiration):**
```
You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.
```

**After (Bardic Inspiration):**
```
You can inspire others through stirring words or music.

**How to use:**
- Use a bonus action on your turn
- Choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet who can hear you
- That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die (d6)

**How it works:**
- Within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw
- The creature can wait until after rolling the d20 before deciding to use the die
- Must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails
- Once rolled, the die is lost
- A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time

**Uses:** Number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once)
**Recovery:** Regain expended uses when you finish a long rest

**Die progression:**
- 1st-4th level: d6
- 5th-9th level: d8
- 10th-14th level: d10
- 15th+ level: d12
```

## Technical Implementation

### **Rich Text Editor Integration**

#### **Component Updates**
```typescript
// Before: Basic textarea
<Textarea
  value={infusion.description}
  onChange={(e) => updateInfusion(index, "description", e.target.value)}
  placeholder="Describe the infusion's effects..."
  rows={3}
/>

// After: Rich text editor
<RichTextEditor
  value={infusion.description}
  onChange={(value) => updateInfusion(index, "description", value)}
  placeholder="Describe the infusion's effects..."
  rows={3}
/>
```

#### **Display Updates**
```typescript
// Before: Plain text
<div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">{feature.description}</div>

// After: Rich text display
<RichTextDisplay content={feature.description} className="text-sm text-muted-foreground" />
```

### **Rich Text Formatting Support**

The `RichTextDisplay` component supports:

- **Bold text**: `**text**` → **text**
- **Bullet points**: `- item` → • item
- **Line breaks**: Proper paragraph separation
- **Lists**: Automatic list formatting for consecutive bullet points

### **Database Updates**

#### **Class Features Formatting**
The `29-improve-class-features-formatting.sql` script updates:

- **Bard College of Lore**: 8 features with improved formatting
- **Artificer Artillerist**: 9 features with improved formatting

#### **Formatting Standards**
- Use `**bold**` for section headings
- Use `- ` for bullet points and lists
- Use line breaks for paragraph separation
- Organize information into logical sections
- Include progression tables for level-based features

## Benefits

### **Developer Benefits**

- **Performance**: Efficient rendering of formatted content

## Usage Examples

### **Creating Rich Text Content**

#### **Infusion Description**
```
**Enhanced Weapon**
- Grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls
- Requires attunement
- Lasts until dispelled or the infusion is removed

**Special Properties:**
- The weapon glows with a faint blue light
- Can be used as a spellcasting focus
- Immune to rust and corrosion
```

#### **Feat Description**
```
**Great Weapon Master**
- On your turn, when you score a critical hit with a melee weapon or reduce a creature to 0 hit points with one, you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action

**Power Attack:**
- Before you make a melee attack with a heavy weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll
- If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage roll
```

#### **Class Feature Description**
```
**Action Surge**
Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment.

**How to use:**
- On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action
- You must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again

**Additional Uses:**
- Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn
```
